                    attack villagers at the beginning of each new year. The monster was afraid of loud noises, bright
                    lights, and the color red, so those things were used to chase the beast away. Celebrations to usher
                    out the old year and bring forth the luck and prosperity of the new one, therefore, often include
                    firecrackers, fireworks, and red clothes and decorations. Young people are given money in colorful
                    red envelopes.

                    According to the legend that is most well-known in contemporary China, the festival honors the
                    passing of Qu Yuan, a poet and minister who lived in the Chu state during the Warring States era of
                    the Zhou dynasty. Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River out of desperation. It is stated that
                    the admiring locals hurried out in their boats to try to save him or at least bring back his body.
                    According to legend, this is where dragon boat competitions began. When they were unable to locate
                    his body, they threw sticky rice balls into the river in hopes that the fish would consume them
                    rather than Qu Yuan's remains. This is supposedly where zongzi got its start.

                    <h3><b>Maulidur Rasul</b></h3><br>
                    Maulidur Rasul, or Mawlid al-Nabi, is a significant celebration in the Malay culture that honors the
                    birth of Prophet Muhammad. It is observed with religious fervor and includes special lectures,
                    processions, and gatherings where the life and teachings of the Prophet are commemorated. Devotees
                    recite poems and offer prayers, emphasizing the importance of following the Prophet's example of
                    compassion, kindness, and righteousness. The festival fosters a sense of spiritual renewal and
                    serves as a reminder of the profound impact of Prophet Muhammad's life on the Malay Muslim
                    community.

        <p><strong>Explore the diverse cuisines of Malaysia:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Malaysian cuisine, Malaysian cuisine or Malaysian cuisine (Malay: Masakan Malaysia), is a local cuisine
in Malaysia, famous for its unique and diverse flavor. It mainly evolved from the unique cuisine of
various ethnic groups such as the Malay aboriginal tribes, Chinese immigrants, Indian immigrants,
Indonesian immigrants, etc. It is greatly influenced by the ingredients and cooking methods of other
ethnic groups, reflecting the multi-ethnic culture of Malaysia. In the process of mutual exchange, the
elements gradually evolved into various Malay dishes influenced by dishes from various places.
        </pre>

        <pre>
Malaysian cuisine uses rice or noodles as the staple food, and usually uses meat or fish cooked in
different flavors as the main course, accompanied by steamed vegetables. The main course food is mostly
eaten with sauce. Generally speaking, Malaysians like to eat spicy food. The spiciness is mainly from
the spiciness in chili peppers, which is spicier than in Thailand.
        </pre>

        <pre>
Although Malaysia is a Muslim-majority country with 60% of the population being Muslims, the government
allows non-halal foods such as pork, crabs and alcoholic beverages to be sold in major supermarkets or
wet markets.

                        <p>
                            The Malay word for Indian pancake is roti canai. Roti refers to "bread", here it means
                            "pancake", and canai means "flattening back and forth", just because the Indian pancake
                            master flattens, air-dries and stretches the dough in the process of making Indian
                            pancakes. There is also a legend that the origin of canai comes from the dough (channal)
                            used when making pancakes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another theory is that the word canai comes from the city of Chennai in India, because
                            when a large number of Indians migrated to Malaysia for gold mining, the Indian pancake
                            chefs at that time were all from Chennai, India.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In India and Singapore, Indian pancakes are also called "prata" pancakes. The shapes of
                            Indian pancakes and burrata pancakes are the same, and burrata pancakes also retain the
                            characteristics of Indian pancakes: round, but usually the ones with fillings are
                            square, which is said to be easier to cook.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many flavors in Malaysia, as follows: Roti Kosong (no filling) Roti Telur (egg
                            flavor) Roti Pisang (banana flavor) Roti Planta (butter flavor), etc. Different regions
                            have different flavors.

                            with spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb,
                            prawn, or fish). In some cases without any meat, and sometimes with eggs and potatoes.

                            Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian

                            This Indian Tandoor Grilled Chicken (Tanddoori Chicken) is a grilled chicken that most
                            friends who have eaten Indian food will have tasted. It is marinated in spices and
                            yogurt and grilled in an upright circular oven.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The same oven is also used to bake Indian naan. The firepower is very strong, and the
                            baked food is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, which is very delicious.
                            Even if you don’t have a Tandoor oven at home, you can still make delicious Tandoori
                            chicken in the oven!

                            The traditional Tandoori grilled chicken is red. In ancient times, it was dyed with
                            saffron. Nowadays, most restaurants use pigments instead of expensive saffron.

                            The Malay word for nasi lemak is "nasi lemak", "nasi" means rice, and lemak
                            originally means fat, which here refers to coconut milk; it is named after
                            soaking rice in coconut milk and then cooking it into rice. Generally, an
                            ordinary pot or rice cooker can be used; sometimes knotted pandan leaves are put
                            into the pot and cooked together. Spices such as turmeric and lemongrass can
                            also be added to increase the aroma of nasi lemak.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            A pack of nasi lemak is served on a plate with banana leaves as the base, sliced
                            cucumbers, small anchovies, roasted peanuts, and some are served with fried
                            kangkong and hard-boiled eggs (boiled or fried), Indian pickles and sambal (a
                            sauce made from shrimp paste and chilli).
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            Many nasi lemak rice dishes also come with other ingredients such as chicken,
                            octopus or squid, clams, biscotti, beef curry (beef simmered in a mixture of
                            coconut milk and spices) or balu (beef lungs). Traditionally, most condiments
                            are hot and spicy, as well as the cooling and antipyretic cucumber.

                        <p>
                            Traditional nasi lemak is eaten for breakfast in the morning. You can see it
                            being sold at roadside stalls in Malaysia starting in the early morning. Now due
                            to the popularity of nasi lemak, it is basically sold at market stalls or
                            stores. It is usually sold wrapped in newspapers, oil paper or banana leaves.
                            Regardless, some restaurants serve it on a plate for lunch or dinner.

                        <p>
                            Rendang (also known as Padang in Hong Kong) is a spicy meat delicacy that
                            originated from the Minangkabau people in Indonesia. As one of the
                            representatives of Minangkabau food culture, it often becomes a delicacy on the
                            table in formal occasions or when showing respect to guests.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Rendang is also common among the Malays of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and
                            among the Moros in the southern Philippines. Traditionally, the Minangkabau
                            people make rendang during festive occasions, such as traditional ceremonies,
                            weddings, and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although rendang is often considered a type of curry, it is not typically
                            classified as such in Indonesia because rendang is richer and contains less
                            liquid than the average Indonesian curry.

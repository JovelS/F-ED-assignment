                 In this era, kids nowadays do not play traditional games as much as 90s kids like me once upon a time ago where rich kids brag having a Game Boy Colour while some play teraju selipar. 
                 However, children in rural areas are still being very fond and interested in playing traditional games, with such inadequate privilege to afford smartphones or tablets. 
                 In fact, traditional games are the go-to activities for those kids who live in rural areas as that is they find leisure with this and used it to bond with one another.
                 Sadly, traditional games seem to be fading away from the interest of the millennials. Therefore, here’s a throwback to our parents’ favourite games when they were young.

                <h2>Batu Seremban</h2>
            <p>
                Batu Seremban is well-known in Kedah, Selangor, Kelantan and Johor. 
                Also known as Permainan Batu Selambut or Serembat, it is played 
                individually in groups of two to four people. Five objects named as 
                'buah' (game piece) are required, consisting of rubber seed, glass 
                marble, bean bag, pebbles or small wrapping of cloth as some of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                A game piece is hurled in different ways at each stage of playing, 
                starting from the first stage using the 'buah satu' (game piece one) 
                up to the next or the highest stage named as 'buah tujuh' (game piece seven)
                or 'raja'. After that is 'dandling the game pieces' for getting points. 
                A 'defunct game' means a player has to stop playing and the next round of 
                game is given to the next player in line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Issues that may cause a 'defunct game' status is that, among others, 
                if there were a game piece that touches another one when the player spread
                them onto the playing surface like the ground, floor and the like. Apart 
                from the hand, other body parts such as the feet, the knees and the like must
                not come into contact with the rest of the game pieces.

                <h2>Congkak</h2>
                <p>
                    Congkak is a traditional Malay game often played as an indoor activity or as a 
                    competition. Often, it uses hollow perforated wooden planks or holes on the 
                    ground and usually a ‘buah’ (game piece) using rubber seeds or marbles.
                </p>
                <p> In Southeast Asia, Congkak may develop from Melaka as the state is a trading 
                    center in the past. The name "congkak" is believed to be derived from the Malay 
                    word "congak" which means mental calculation. Besides the Malays, the Congkak 
                    game is also famous among the descendants of Indian and Baba Malacca. In the 
                    Caribbean Congkak is known as Warri or Awari. In Indonesia, Congkak is known 
                    by the name Congklak, while in the Philippines, Sungka.
                </p>    
                <p>In a Congkak set, there are two components which are the Congkak board and 
                    Congkak piece. The board are shaped like boats and can be made from different 
                    types of wood or by digging holes on the ground. There are five to seven 
                    inline holes known as 'kampung' (village) and at both ends there is a main 
                    hole known as 'rumah'(home). The lenght of the 7 holes Congkak board is usually 
                    around 80 cm wide and the diameter of the seven holes is usually about 18 cm.
                </p>     
                <p> 
                    In this game, the player will start it simultaneously. They will take Congkak 
                    piece from any of the ‘kampung’(usually around 7 piece per ‘kampung’) and put 
                    one at a time into subsequent ‘kampung’s in a clockwise direction. The main goal 
                    is to put as many Congkak piece in respective ‘rumah’. One’s round ended when 
                    the Congkak piece stop in an empty ‘kampung’. Ones own ‘rumah’ is located at 
                    the left end of each player. Each player will continue the game until the each 
                    ‘kampung’ runs out of Congkak pieces. A player with the most Congkak pieces in 
                    their ‘rumah’ takes the win.

                <h2>Gasing</h2>
                <p>
                    “Spinning Top” or known as Gasing is a traditional game in Malaysia played by 
                    children mainly, young boys. Gasing originally comes from the state of Kelantan. 
                    At Kelantan, after the rice harvest season, villagers will meet up and challenge 
                    one another in a round of gasing to test their skills. The villagers believe that 
                    by playing gasing, it would give them good harvest. Subsequently, gasing is played 
                    on a flat open area by children and adults. However, the gasing used by adults 
                    are much bigger in size and able to spin for a longer time compared to ones used 
                    by kids which are smaller in size. Gasing is made of wood and weighs around 0.5 to 
                    1.0 kilograms. The different shapes of gasing are plate-shaped, heart-shaped, hat-top 
                    and berembang-shaped. Gasing Berembang are named because it is made from freely 
                    accessible fruit on the seafront. The fruit is round, somewhat flat and smooth.

                <h2>Guli</h2>
                <p>
                    Guli or known as marbles is one of the simpler games played back in the olden days. 
                    A game of Guli is suitable for both girls and boys aged between seven years old to 
                    twelve years old. Furthermore, number of players should not exceed five people. It 
                    is usually played on a flat open surface and a circle drawn with an approximately 
                    diameter of 1 metre. This game is not as easy as it looks. This is because, this 
                    game involves throwing a guli on the target accurately. In addition, these marbles 
                    are very small and the type of guli used to play this game are the ones made of 
                    limestone and its round.

                <h2>Wau</h2>
                <p>
                    Wau is one of the popular traditional games in Malaysia played since hundreds of 
                    years ago. Wau consists of authentic Malay motifs that can be seen in the form of 
                    patterns and the design available. Back then, villagers used to believe that the vines 
                    symbolize a man’s life and the flowers represent a woman’s life. This game is popular 
                    in rural areas especially in the East Coast of Malaysia which is in Kelantan, Terengganu, 
                    also in the Northern states of Perlis and Kedah. Wau are usually played at the end of 
                    harvest season as a form of de-stress after working in the fields.  This is a game that 
                    tests the skills and efficiency of the player in making and flying the kite. Usually played 
                    by male adults, there is no fixed number of players. In fact, the more the merrier. Played 
                    in open areas, this game requires a kite and long strings or yarn. The game can also be 
                    played as a competition to choose the highest-flying kite, the most skilful player in flying 
                    the kite, the kite that makes the best melodious sound, the most colourful kite, the kite 
                    with the most beautiful drawing and the kite that flies in the straightest manner. The three 
                    types of wau are Wau Bulan, Wau Kucing and Wau Jala Budi. Wau Bulan, named for its crescent 
                    like tail shape. Wau Jala Budi or known as woman’s kite, takes the curves of a woman and Wau 
                    Kucing, named after a shape resembling a cat that is sitting from the rear corner, starting
